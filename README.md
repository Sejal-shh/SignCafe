# Python Hand Recognition Coffee Server App ü§ö‚òï

Welcome to the Python Hand Recognition Coffee Server App repository! ‚òï

This innovative application, built with Python's OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries, harnesses the power of machine learning to serve coffee to individuals with hearing and speech impairments using hand gestures. The app detects hand movements and recognizes specific gestures, enabling seamless communication and coffee service.

## Features

- **Hand Gesture Recognition:** The app employs advanced computer vision techniques to accurately detect hand movements and recognize predefined gestures, translating them into actionable commands.

- **Deaf and Dumb Communication:** By interpreting hand gestures, the app bridges the communication gap for individuals with hearing and speech impairments, allowing them to effortlessly request a cup of coffee.

- **Coffee Serving Automation:** Once the app recognizes the appropriate hand gesture, it triggers the coffee-serving mechanism, ensuring that a fresh cup of coffee is dispensed promptly.

## How It Works

1. The app utilizes Python's OpenCV library to capture real-time video from a camera or webcam.

2. The captured video frames are processed using MediaPipe, a powerful library for building applications involving real-time perception.

3. Machine learning models integrated into MediaPipe accurately identify and track hand movements, recognizing predefined gestures that correspond to different coffee preferences.

4. Upon detecting the specified gesture, the app triggers the coffee-serving mechanism, allowing users to enjoy their desired coffee.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the Python Hand Recognition Coffee Server App! This section will guide you through the process of setting up and running the application step by step.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-hand-recognition-coffee-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd python-hand-recognition-coffee-app
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages using pip:
   ```
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe
   ```
### Running the App
1. Run the 'main.py' script to launch the coffee server app:
   ```
   python python_app.py
   ```
2. The app will utilize your computer's webcam to capture real-time video. A window will open displaying the video feed.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate the app for optimal hand gesture recognition. This step ensures accurate detection and interpretation of your 
    hand movements.
4. Once calibrated, start making hand gestures in front of the webcam. The app will recognize predefined gestures and trigger the coffee-serving mechanism 
   accordingly.
